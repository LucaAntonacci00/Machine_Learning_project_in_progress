# BTC 15-Minute Event Contract Prediction Project

## Overview

This project explores whether a data-driven model can predict short-term Bitcoin price movements over a 15-minute horizon well enough to outperform simple baselines in event-style contract markets.

The focus is not just prediction accuracy, but whether signals are strong enough to generate a measurable edge in contracts such as:

- “Will BTC be up in 15 minutes?”
- “Will BTC be above/below X price in 15 minutes?”

This is an experimental research project designed to test hypotheses about short-horizon price behavior under realistic constraints.

## Core Question

Can short-term structure in Bitcoin price and volume data produce a statistically meaningful edge over:

- Random guessing  
- Naive directional bias  
- Simple momentum rules  

And if so, is that edge large enough to matter once trading friction, noise, and regime shifts are considered?

---

## Project Constraints

This project is intentionally built under several real-world constraints:

### 1. Limited Data Granularity
Currently, the model primarily relies on standard OHLCV market data. It does not yet incorporate:

- Full order book depth
- Trade-level microstructure data
- Funding rates or derivatives positioning
- Market-implied probabilities from contract platforms

These limitations restrict how much short-term signal can realistically be extracted.

---

### 2. Non-Stationary Market Conditions
Bitcoin’s behavior changes across regimes:

- Trending vs. ranging environments
- High vs. low volatility periods
- News-driven price shocks

Any performance observed in one regime may degrade in another. This project treats robustness across time as more important than peak performance in a narrow window.

---

### 3. Short Horizon Noise
A 15-minute window is inherently noisy. Signal-to-noise ratio is low, and:

- Small price moves dominate outcomes
- Slippage and spreads matter
- Edge must be meaningfully larger than random variance

This project does not assume easy predictability at this horizon.

---

### 4. Data Quality and Label Definitions
Outcome definitions (e.g., up/down, threshold X) significantly influence results.

Label construction is sensitive to:
- Exact timestamp alignment
- Candle boundaries
- Forward return calculation method

As data improves, label precision must also improve.

---

## Current Limitations

At this stage, the project is constrained by:

- Basic feature set
- Limited external market context
- Simplified evaluation assumptions
- Incomplete modeling of transaction costs

Results should be interpreted as preliminary research rather than deployable trading signals.

---

## Iteration Strategy

This project is designed to evolve as data quality improves.

When better data becomes available, key areas to update include:

### 1. Feature Inputs
Add:
- Order book imbalance
- Liquidity shifts
- Real-time volatility measures
- Derivatives positioning data

### 2. Market Context
Incorporate:
- Broader crypto market correlations
- Macro event markers
- Funding rate regimes

### 3. Contract-Specific Modeling
If market-implied probabilities are available:
- Compare predicted probability vs. market price
- Model expected value directly
- Adjust for payout structure

### 4. Realistic Friction Modeling
Include:
- Spread assumptions
- Fee structure
- Latency effects

## Evaluation Philosophy

The goal is not to maximize raw accuracy.

Instead, evaluation prioritizes:

- Stability over time
- Calibration of probabilities
- Edge relative to baseline
- Sensitivity to regime shifts

A small but consistent edge is more meaningful than a high but unstable hit rate.

---

## Future Directions

Planned improvements include:

- Better data feeds
- Regime detection
- Probability calibration refinements
- Ensemble modeling approaches
- Live simulation testing
